# PrecisePi

This is a project we did for the number theory course(sem 4). It calculates pi upto arbitrary level of precision. Also available is calculation of square root of any real number. 

Here we have considered all numbers as C++ vectors to allow for as large of a number as needed. 

We have implemented addition,subtraction,multiplication and division of these vector numbers in the process of calculating square root and Pi.
